# ANTI SLEEP ALARM FOR DRIVERS


# Overview
The Anti-Sleep Alarm for Drivers project addresses the critical issue of driver fatigue and aims to enhance road safety by detecting signs of drowsiness. The system combines several components to monitor the driver’s alertness and provide timely alerts to prevent accidents.


# Components
1. Arduino Uno
2. IR Goggles
3. LCD Screen
4. Mini Buzzer
5. Motor and Wheel (simulating vehicle movement)
6. Jumper Wires

# Working Flow
1. Detection: IR Goggles monitor the driver’s blinking frequency to detect signs of drowsiness.
2. Processing: Arduino Board receives input from the IR goggles and processes the blinking frequency.
3. Alert Mechanism:
   a) Timer Start: Initiates a timer once drowsiness is detected.
   b) LCD Screen displays a welcome message and countdown.
   c) Buzzer Activation: Sounds at a low volume initially, increasing if drowsiness persists.
4. Vehicle Response:
   a) Volume Increase: If drowsiness continues, the buzzer’s volume gradually increases.
   b) Vehicle Stop: Sends a signal to stop the vehicle if drowsiness remains unaddressed.
5. Reset:
   a) System Reset: Resets once the driver responds by blinking or moving, stopping the buzzer and LCD countdown.
